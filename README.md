## üí≥ Reactor Wallet

Rector Wallet is an **experimental** wallet for the [Solana Blockchain](https://solana.com) made with Flutter.

Its on **alpha** stage, be careful when using it.

**NOTE**: This project was started as side project, but now, I will showcase it in [Solana Riptide Hackathon](https://solana.com/riptide). I will also work on it when the hackathon is over.

### üòé Features
- Experimental [Solana Pay](https://solanapay.com) integration
- Watch over any address you want
- Display SPL Tokens and transactions
- Import and create multiple wallets
- Show the USD equivalent of the address balance and all it's tokens combined
- You can see collectives (aka NFTs)

It should work fine on **Android** and **Windows**, I haven't tried on the other platforms.

### üè≠ Building
```
flutter build apk --tree-shake-icons --split-per-abi --dart-define secureKey=<32CharactersLengthSecretKey>

Note: `secureKey` is used to internally encrypt and decrypt the wallets's passphrases when using the app.

### üìù Formatting
```
dart format . --line-length 100
```
